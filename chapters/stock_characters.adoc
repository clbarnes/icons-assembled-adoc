= Stock characters
Icons Game Masters can create villains and other characters to populate
their adventures as they see fit.
To make things a bit easier, this
section presents various "stock" character types, ones that appear in a
lot of superhero comics.
You can use their traits as-is, just filling in
the descriptive details, or modify them to suit the needs of your
adventure.

Some stock characters, particularly villainous henchmen, can use the
minions option for damage (see the Damage section for details).
In this
case, ignore their listed Stamina value; any successful attack against
them renders them unconscious.
