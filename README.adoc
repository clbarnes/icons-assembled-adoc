An https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] rendition of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License[Open Game Content] of https://stevekenson.com/icons/[ICONS: Superpowered Roleplaying _The Assembled Edition_], by https://stevekenson.com/[Steve Kenson].

== Usage

Requires https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[docker].

`make` will install the docker image and build a web page at `build/index.html`.

== History

The content included here was forked from https://github.com/open-ttrpg-library/icons-adoc[the base ICONS repo], which was originally adapted from http://ogc.rpglibrary.org/index.php?title=Icons[the RPGlibrary wiki]; __Assembled__'s updates will be added from the rule book as time goes on.

It is a work in progress, with the goal to have a faithful, beautiful, and forkable base from which the ICONS ecosystem can continue to grow.

== Support the authors

ICONS is a great game with a https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/131765/ICONS-Superpowered-Roleplaying-The-Assembled-Edition[well-presented rule book] and a https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4166/Ad-Infinitum-Adventures[large library of ready-made adventures], which I encourage you to buy.
