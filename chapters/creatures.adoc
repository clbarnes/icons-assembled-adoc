= Creatures

The following are some examples of common creatures -- primarily mundane animals -- you can use in your Icons game.
They may be minions, pets, summoned by Animal Control powers, or potential models for characters with animal-like abilities.
Abilities listed with an asterisk (\*) are "off the scale" -- too low to be considered -- and can effectively be treated as level 0.
"Running" under Notes acts like the Athletics specialty for ground movement, adding to the creature's effective Coordination.
